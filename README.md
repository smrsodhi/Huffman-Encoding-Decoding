# Huffman-Encoding-Decoding

1. Clear any text/data from "source.txt", "destination.txt", "header.huffh" and "body.huffb" before using
2. Write your text in "source.txt"
3. Run "compressor.cpp"
4. At this point you can see that "header.huffh" and "body.huffb" have been written into; that is the compressed text
5. Run "decompressor.cpp"
6. Now you can see the decompressed text in "destination.txt"
